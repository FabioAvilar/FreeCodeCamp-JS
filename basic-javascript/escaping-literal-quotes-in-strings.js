// Use backslashes to assign a string to the myStr variable so that if you were to print it to the console, you would see:

// I am a "double quoted" string inside "double quotes".

// You should use two double quotes (") and four escaped double quotes (\").
// Waiting:Variable myStr should contain the string: I am a "double quoted" string inside "double quotes".

// const myStr = ""; // Change this line

const myStr = 'I am a "double quoted" string inside "double quotes".'; // Change this line

console.log(myStr);
