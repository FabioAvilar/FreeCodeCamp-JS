// You will need to use the string concatenation operator + to build a new string, using the provided variables: myNoun, myAdjective, myVerb, and myAdverb. You will then assign the formed string to the wordBlanks variable. You should not change the words assigned to the variables.

// You will also need to account for spaces in your string, so that the final sentence has spaces between all the words. The result should be a complete sentence.

// Waiting:wordBlanks should be a string.
// Waiting:You should not change the values assigned to myNoun, myVerb, myAdjective or myAdverb.
// Waiting:You should not directly use the values dog, ran, big, or quickly to create wordBlanks.
// Waiting:wordBlanks should contain all of the words assigned to the variables myNoun, myVerb, myAdjective and myAdverb separated by non-word characters (and any additional words of your choice).

// const myNoun = "dog";
// const myAdjective = "big";
// const myVerb = "ran";
// const myAdverb = "quickly";

// const wordBlanks = ""; // Change this line
